# wk5-PLP-python
This Python project shows basic OOP concepts like creating classes, using constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism. It includes designing a custom class and using method overriding.
Sure! Here's a *short description* and *README-style summary* of your assignment:

---

This Python project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as class creation, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism. It includes two main parts:

---

*Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class*
- A custom class `Smartphone` was created with attributes like brand, model.
- Constructors are used to initialize objects with unique values.

---

*Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge*
- A base class `Vehicle` defines a common method `move()`.
- Subclasses `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` override `move()` to show different behaviors, demonstrating polymorphism.

---

*Outcome:*
- Understanding of class design, inheritance, and method overriding.
- Use of polymorphism through shared interfaces with custom behavior.
- Real-world simulation of different objects and their actions.
